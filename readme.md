# Test Automation Project using Cucumber Java

Project is created for TNT, as test assignment.


## Getting Started

It is a Maven Java project that can be cloned, build and run directly.

## Summary

I tried to cover the TNT core functionalities with E2E tests. 
I tried to make tests not flaky by adding proper expected conditions for webelements.

With given more time, code can be refectored and improved.

## Bug
I was facing styling issue on TNT.com home page on windows platform.

## Acknowledgments

This is a sole project written by me, code is not used from anywhere.
